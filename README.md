Tinkr provides a comprehensive set of GUI controls that allow you to quickly develop graphic applications for NETMF devices with natively supported screens as well as support for the new Skewworks Image32 and multiple application standards!

The initial code of Tinkr v2.5.0 was donated by Skewworks (www.Skewworks.com).
