Since SHFB does currently not support NETMF, two files must be exchanged:

%ProgramFilesx86%\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\Frameworks.xml
This files contains all Framework assemblies

%ProgramFilesx86%\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\MRefBuilder.exe
There is a problem when MRefBuilder tries to find out if a member is the default member.
This project contains a patched version of MRefBuilder.exe which ignores the exception in this case.

Simply overwrite these two files in the SHFB installation folder.
Please make backup copies before that.

There is no guaranty that this will work in all cases.
All changes are based on SHFB v2014.2.15.0 Beta.
